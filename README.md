# SFML-Particle-simulation

## Simple Particle simulation with SFML

<br>

### You should build SFML library to Compile & build this Repo

can install here -> https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php

<br>

Vertex Buffer can handle 3,000,000+ particles smoothly with GPU's super fast calculation

<br>

### Usage
left click to make particles, right click to make force to control particles.

gravity(force) should be multiplied by (distance ^ 2) in our physics, but i thought without multiply is cooler.
